# Functions and Errors 

The Functions and Errors Library is a collection of utility functions designed to enhance code modularity and handle errors gracefully in your applications.
It provides a set of reusable functions for common tasks and a structured error-handling mechanism to improve the robustness of your code.

## Features:
Utility Functions
Error Handling

## Description:
The provided Solidity smart contract is named ab and contains three functions. The first function, twosquare, takes two unsigned integer parameters, a and b, and ensures
that their squares sum up to 1. If the condition is not met, it triggers a requirement error with a custom message. The second function, formula, checks a mathematical formula
involving a and b. If the formula is not satisfied, it reverts with an error message; otherwise, it returns a success message.The third function, unique_variable,asserts that the 
two input variables a and b are not equal. If the assertion holds true, indicating unique variables, it returns a message allowing the user to proceed with the function.The 
contract is equipped with SPDX-License-Identifier set to MIT, indicating its open-source nature and permissive licensing.This code snippet showcases basicmathematical and 
assertion-based validations within a Solidity smart contract.
