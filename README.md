# Functions and Errors 

This Solidity smart contract provides a set of functions for mathematical operations. The twosquare function calculates the sum of squares and checks if it equals zero, the formula function validates a specific mathematical formula, and the unique_variable function asserts the uniqueness of variables.

## Features:
Function 1: twosquare

Calculates the sum of squares and ensures that the result is equal to zero.
Function 2: formula

Validates a mathematical formula involving square roots and checks if it is satisfied.
Function 3: unique_variable

Asserts the uniqueness of variables, allowing the execution of the function only if variables are unique.

## Description:
The provided Solidity smart contract is named ab and contains three functions. The first function, twosquare, takes two unsigned integer parameters, a and b, and ensures
that their squares sum up to 1. If the condition is not met, it triggers a requirement error with a custom message. The second function, formula, checks a mathematical formula
involving a and b. If the formula is not satisfied, it reverts with an error message; otherwise, it returns a success message.The third function, unique_variable,asserts that the 
two input variables a and b are not equal. If the assertion holds true, indicating unique variables, it returns a message allowing the user to proceed with the function.The 
contract is equipped with SPDX-License-Identifier set to MIT, indicating its open-source nature and permissive licensing.This code snippet showcases basicmathematical and 
assertion-based validations within a Solidity smart contract.
